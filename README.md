# Computer_Screen_Control

This is a very simple program which I wrote for automatically opening the applications when I restart my computer. Normally, I have a lot of applications opened on my machine and sometimes due to software updates I have to restart my computer which basically annoys me since I have to launch the applications from scratch again. In order to mitigate this problem and make my life a bit easier, I wrote this short program which uses Python packages for automatically opening my applications of interest.

**Note**: You need to provide the template (screenshot of the logo) of the application which you want this program to open. In my case, I have added all these templates to the `./templates` folder.

# Installation

Open command prompt on Windows/terminal on Linux and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Make sure to change the path and reside in this folder before running this program. Run `restart_programs.py` and see the magic.
